# is-useless

why npm why
=======
Reflecting on the current state of npm where people install a package with 5 dependencies rather than write a single mathmatical equation to find out whether or not their variable is even or odd

## installation
Using npm:
```shell
npm i is-useless
```
In Node.js:
```js
const isUseless = require("is-useless");
```

## Usage
```js
const isUseless = require("is-useless");

console.log(isUseless(process.env.CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER)); // may or may not send to servers for product improvement
```
